[Libretto Manual (PDF)](https://github.com/danhetrick/libretto/blob/master/manual.pdf)

**Libretto** is a tool for writing Internet Relay Chat bots, and small, limited use IRC servers. It uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine as a language base, and features over 75 new functions to make writing IRC software easy:

* **If you know JavaScript, you already know Libretto.** Libretto uses Google's V8 ECMAScript engine, the JavaScript engine used in the Chrome web browser.
* **Make complex or simple IRC bots.** Libretto uses an event system, and features all the "boring" functionality that every IRC bot needs, so you can get busy writing the fun stuff.
* **Full file I/O.** Create and edit files and directories.  Functions to create, modify, and extract zip archives are included, too.
* **Create IRC servers to make bot development easy.** Creating a simple IRC server in Libretto takes only a single line of code.
